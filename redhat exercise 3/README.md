Disclaimer: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
README-generated was generated by the script.

I used the built in react scripts to handle building and deploying to the localhost (building via npm), and used npm
for dependency management as well.

I used React as the web framework, and organized the code into Containers and Components. Containers are classes that
are responsible for data fetching and passing that data to specific component renderers - the Component classes.
Component classes are responsible solely for rendering their received data. This pattern allows you to build applications
via composition, with pages that have one or more containers, which use the modular and reusable components.

Re: UserDetailsContainer. Because of the requirement that the details page must be bookmarkable, the url to a specific
user's details must be directly navigable. Therefore, data for the user must be fetched again. Otherwise, the table
passes the user data directly to the user details container.

I also brought in Ant Design, leveraging it's compositional Table widget to render the json user data, as well as
utilizing its theme to provide some basic styling and layout structure. Custom styling was done in css.

Unit testing was done using Enzyme and Jest. Originally going to use Mocha. but bootstrapped base project has some
limitations regarding test framework. I couldn't easily move the test directory out of src.
