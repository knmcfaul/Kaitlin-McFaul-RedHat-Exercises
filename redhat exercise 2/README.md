To run:

Open box.html in your local browser.

Additional Notes:

I wrote the html to mimic the image's data and created the css to match the image's design. I opted to link the Overpass font via html rather than importing its font files and statically linking them to keep the code base small. I used the colors provided in the documentation but at least on my local moniter the difference in grays for the background gradient was very small, so I ensured that the double gradients were correct by locally editing the color to a harsher contrast.
